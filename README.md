# MIDI WebView example

This app uses [DOM Components](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/dom-components/) to access iOS MIDI APIs from a WebView. The MIDI APIs are exposed through the [SimpleMidi module](https://github.com/brentvatne/midi-webview-example/tree/main/modules/simple-midi) that was generated by Claude 4.0.

## How to run it

- Clone the repo
- Run `bun install`
- Run `bun expo prebuild -p ios` to generate the Xcode project (this is called [CNG](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/continuous-native-generation/)).
- Run `bun expo start`
- Open the Xcode project and compile and run it on your physical iOS device or "My Mac". iOS simulators do not support MIDI.
- You can use [ShowMIDI](https://github.com/gbevin/ShowMIDI) to monitor the MIDI messages sent from the app.
